As part of my final year project I worked on making a realtime AI looking at different decision making algorithms in Unity.

There wasn't many free behaviour tree packages for unity, as it's not built into the engine like unreal, and the one I used had issues with keeping nodes linked when the engine was restarted or the project was saved to git. It also had a bunch of usability and accessibility issues which I intend to try and tackle with this project.

This is currently a work in progress, you can read about the plans for it by looking at the wiki tab, which will also explain core features of the application.

This is being developed as a tool for project Lares but is free to be used by others and eventually will hopefully be available on itch.io and unitys asset store.
